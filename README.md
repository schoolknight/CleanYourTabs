A Chrome extension to clean your Chrome tabs.

---------
Frankly, I write this chrome extension mostly for myself.
I am a heavy Chrome user, and always leave hundreds of tabs open.
Even open same web pages multiple times.  
So, I never find the tabs I really need, and it costs too much time.
This extension is created to help me clean my tabs and find the tabs in need.

### Install



### Usage
- The default shortcut is CTRL-B (Windows) / COMMAND-B (OSX)
- You can configure the extension in the option page.

Simple enough right?
